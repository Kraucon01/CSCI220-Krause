              <h2>Info About the Hobby</h2>
            <p>
                It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth.<br>
                He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies.<br>
                He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium <br>
                for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.
                <br>
                Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested <br>
                miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of <br>
                the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the <br>
                Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard <br>
                and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to <br>
                name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, <br>
                heretics, mutants - and worse.
                <br>
                To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody <br>
                regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much <br>
                has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark <br>
                future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the <br>
                laughter of thirsting gods.
                <br><br>
                If you couldn't tell the setting for this particular hobby is a very dark and depressing place with forms of comedy<br>
                sprinkled in here and there. The main hobby itself is about collecting paintable miniatures from one, or more, factions<br>
                within the setting. Now you can just collect the models and not worry about painting them if you just want to use them<br>
                in a game for the hobby.The inverse is true as well and trust me when I say there are some really beautiful and amazing<br>
                painted models out there. It also includes tournaments, both local and official, that you can enter if your feeling<br>
                <i>competitive</i>.

                Now there are a lot of different factions in this universe with their own complicated lore and stories you can explore.<br>
                However, since the purpose of this video is to introduce new comers to the hobby this site won't go to deep into the lore.<br>
                But, there will be links down at the bottom of this page for you to check out if you are interested in learning about the lore.<br>
                Now with that out of the way lets get into the three major groupings of the factions in this universe.<br>

              <h2>The Imperium of Mankind</h2>

                  The Imperium of Man is the galaxy spanning empire of mankind that has managed to sustain itself even after the fall of their<br>
                  now skeletal Emperor. They are considered one of the big bads in the universe do to the simple fact that man doesn't care for<br>
                  the lives of its people if they do not serve their Emperor. They are gothic by design and, quite frankly, possesses the most<br>
                  subfactions with in themselves. Such as the infamous poster boys of the Space Marines and all of their own seperate factions.<br>
                  Along with the Adeptus Custodes, Soroitas, the Inquisition, the Astra Militarum, and many more. If you notices the pattern here<br>
                  then you realize that man has become a religious parody of itself that will kill each other left and right if they suspect you<br>
                  their supposed *ahem* <i><b><em>HERESY</em></b></i>. But, they are the most basic yet versitaile force in their galaxy, well so<br>
                  long as they can stop killing each other in the millions.

        <P>
            Now there are a lot of different factions in this universe with their own complicated lore and stories you can explore.<br>
            However, since the purpose of this video is to introduce new comers to the hobby this site won't go to deep into the lore.<br>
            But, there will be links down at the bottom of this page for you to check out if you are interested in learning about the lore.<br>
            Now with that out of the way lets get into the three major groupings of the factions in this universe. However it is also<br>
            encouraged that you make up your own little faction of each race in the setting because of one thing <b>Everyting is Canon!</b><br>
            not in the sense that everything in all the official media is true but rather that all games, all made up factions, and even<br>
            webshows in some way or form are Canon to everything in the universe. So go out and have fun with this new knowledge however<br>
            you see fit. Any who the main 3 generalized, for time and sanity, factions are the Imperium of Mankind, Xeno's races, and the<br>
            Monsterous Hordes of Chaos. Each one has their own particular sub factions which are actually explained in the lore of the <br>
            universe. However, as stated we won't be going over all of it but I will give you a general idea of how each general faction<br>
            plays in the game itself. There will also be recources down below that you can see to get a better understanding of them.<br>
            With that out of the way lets get too it.

              Our thoughts light the Darkness that others may cross space.<br>
              We are one with Emperor our souls are joined at his will.<br>
              Praise the Emperor whose sacrifice is life as our is death.<br>

              The Imperium of Man is the galaxy spanning empire of mankind that has managed to sustain itself even after the fall of their<br>
              now skeletal Emperor. They are considered one of the big bads in the universe do to the simple fact that man doesn't care for<br>

      <div class="Xeno">
          <h2>The Xeno's from the Stars</h2>
          <p>
              The Xenos is the generic term given to just about all non-human races within the universe that range from mystical space elves<br>
              all the way to giant planet eating bugs. Now, like the Imperium they have a quite a few sub factions under this general title<br>
              but they are all much more specialized in a certain style of combat that while overlaps a little is still unique to each faction.<br>
              This can range from being a horde of glass cannons that you need to play weirdly to win, letting lady luck take the wheel while <br>
              going ham, and even just being the ever paitent firing line that will shoot anyone that attacks their units. However, due to <br>
              these specializations they can be hard countered at times if they don't prepare for them in advance. Additionally, While some<br>
              factions can work together in an army they need to be of the same race and they need to have some form of synergy. However, if<br>
              you really want a challenge and love doing a specific thing really well then any of the Xenos races are for you. Also as a bit<br>
              of warning to all be prepared to be called all kinds of things depending on the which of the races you play. These are some but<br>
              but not limited to edgy sweat goblin, greenskin rng boiz, pansies, space weeb communist and many more given the fanbases need to<br>
              reuse some old jokes for the sake of fun. This is all only in jest so if you find something cool then just play it.
          </p>
      </div>
<br>
      <div class="Chaos">
            <h2>The Daemons of Chaos</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This faction is all about the supernatural forces of the universe that stems from this place called "The Warp". Now this place<br>
                is sort of like the inside of a black hole mixed with the collect thoughts, feelings, and emotions of all soul bearing species.<br>
                Combine it with the fact that it is ruled by four of the most terrifying and down right malicious monsters that exist and you <br>
                basically have what many in the community dub as <i><b>Super Ultra Murder Death Hell</b></i>. Now, the sub factions in this one<br>
                are a bit more off the wall considering they actually allow you to just have a hoard of Daemons ready to go and murder just<br>
                anything they can. They also have their own Space Marines that are called Chaos Marines that betrayed their race to <br>
                to serve one of the main driving forces in the Warp known only as The Chaos Gods. There are four in total, Tzeench, Khorne, Nergal<br>
                and Slaneesh. Additionally, Daemons are just smaller aspects of these gods that can be brought back at any time if they are<br>
                destroyed. This combined with the fact that just knowing Chaos exists can turn anyone into their slaves makes this particular<br>
                faction seem like it is just an unstoppable force that will never end. In all honesty, lore wise this is exactly what they are<br>
                but on the table top they are mearly a go in and hit face style of army when they don't have the Chaos Marines and just purly<br>
                Daemons.
                If you wish to know about these supposed gods there is a link just below in the recources that can explain what they are<br>
                and why they are considered gods and malevolent beings.
