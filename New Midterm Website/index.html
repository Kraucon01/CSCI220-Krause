              <h2>Info About the Hobby</h2>
            <p>
                It is the 41st Millennium. For more than a hundred centuries The Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth.<br>
                He is the Master of Mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies.<br>
                He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium <br>
                for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.
                <br>
                Yet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested <br>
                miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of <br>
                the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst his soldiers are the <br>
                Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard <br>
                and countless planetary defence forces, the ever vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to <br>
                name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, <br>
                heretics, mutants - and worse.
                <br>
                To be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody <br>
                regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much <br>
                has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark <br>
                future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the <br>
                laughter of thirsting gods.
                <br><br>
                If you couldn't tell the setting for this particular hobby is a very dark and depressing place with forms of comedy<br>
                sprinkled in here and there. The main hobby itself is about collecting paintable miniatures from one, or more, factions<br>
                within the setting. Now you can just collect the models and not worry about painting them if you just want to use them<br>
                in a game for the hobby.The inverse is true as well and trust me when I say there are some really beautiful and amazing<br>
                painted models out there. It also includes tournaments, both local and official, that you can enter if your feeling<br>
                <i>competitive</i>.

          <div class="Factions Overview">
            <h2>Factions Within The Setting</h2>
            <P>
                Now there are a lot of different factions in this universe with their own complicated lore and stories you can explore.<br>
                However, since the purpose of this video is to introduce new comers to the hobby this site won't go to deep into the lore.<br>
                But, there will be links down at the bottom of this page for you to check out if you are interested in learning about the lore.<br>
                Now with that out of the way lets get into the three major groupings of the factions in this universe.<br>

          <div class="Imperium Of Mankind">
              <h2>The Imperium of Mankind</h2>
              <P>
                  The Imperium of Man is the galaxy spanning empire of mankind that has managed to sustain itself even after the fall of their<br>
                  now skeletal Emperor.
