<h2> The Experiment Details </h2>
<p> College students consume suprising quantities of caffeine on average. However, this study
seeks to determine if a correlation exists between the amount of caffeing an individual
consumes daily and that individual's grade point average in school. The first control group
recieved caffeine equal to the national average daily. The second control group recieved 
twice the national daily average. Finally, the third control group recieved a palcebo in 
place of actual caffeine. </p>

<h2> The Steps of Reproduction </h2>
<ol type = "1">
    <li> 100 students were selected from volunteer applicants between the ages of 18-22 years 
    old, with equal numbers of female and male participants and with a starting GPA between 
    3.2 and 3.3.</li>
    <li> Each student was assigned a number from 1-100 </li>
    <li> Numbers were then randomly selected and assigned to groups A, B, and C </li>
    <li> Group A was given caffeine equivalent to 3 cups of coffee per day (the national 
    average) </li>
    <li> Group B was given caffeine equivalent to 6 cups of coffee per day </li>
    <li> Group C was given a placebo </li>
    <li> Grade point averages were tracked throughout the term and averaged by group at the 
    start of the semester, at midterm, and after final grades were submitted </li>
